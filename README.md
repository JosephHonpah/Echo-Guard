**Test Credentials**:
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: Test1234!

## Features

- **Audio Transcription**: Automatically transcribe audio recordings using Amazon Transcribe
- **Dual AI Compliance Analysis**: Analyze transcripts using both Amazon Bedrock and Kiro AI
- **Real-time Alerts**: Get notified of potential compliance violations
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Monitor compliance metrics and trends
- **Secure Authentication**: User management with Amazon Cognito
- **Enhanced Compliance**: Specialized financial compliance checks with Kiro AI

## How It Works

EchoGuard follows a streamlined workflow for processing audio recordings:

1. **Upload Process**:
   - User uploads an audio file through the web interface
   - File is stored in an S3 bucket with appropriate metadata
   - Upload event triggers a Lambda function

2. **Transcription**:
   - Lambda function initiates an Amazon Transcribe job
   - Transcribe processes the audio and generates a text transcript
   - Completion notification is sent via SNS

3. **AI Analysis**:
   - Transcript is analyzed by two AI systems in parallel:
     - Amazon Bedrock for general compliance analysis
     - Kiro AI for specialized financial compliance checks
   - Both systems identify potential compliance issues and assign risk scores

4. **Results Processing**:
   - Analysis results are combined and stored in DynamoDB
   - Compliance score is calculated based on weighted factors
   - High-risk issues trigger alerts via SNS

5. **Dashboard Display**:
   - User views results in the dashboard
   - Recordings are listed with compliance scores
   - Detailed view shows specific issues and recommendations

This serverless architecture ensures scalability, cost-efficiency, and real-time processing of audio recordings.

2. **Configure Kiro IDE**:
   - Install the IDE following the provided instructions
   - Launch the IDE and sign in with your developer credentials
   - Create a new project or open the EchoGuard project

3. **Set Up Kiro API Keys**:
   - Generate API keys from the Kiro Developer Portal
   - Add the keys to your project configuration
   - Test the connection to Kiro AI services

4. **Deploy Kiro Models**:
   ```
   cd backend
   ./deploy-kiro.bat
   ```
   Or on Linux/Mac:
   ```
   ./deploy-kiro.sh
   ```

### Using Kiro AI in EchoGuard

Kiro AI provides specialized compliance analysis for financial conversations:

# EchoGuard Direct CloudFront URLs

Since the CloudFront distribution is still propagating or there might be permission issues, here are direct URLs to access specific pages through CloudFront:

## Main Page
https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/index.html

## Login Page
https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/cognito-auth.html

## Signup Page
https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/signup.html

## Upload Guide
https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/upload-guide.html

## Troubleshooting

If you're still seeing "Access Denied" errors, try these steps:

1. Wait 15-30 minutes for CloudFront to fully propagate changes
2. Clear your browser cache or try in an incognito/private window
3. Try accessing the S3 website URL directly: http://echoguard-frontend-656570226565.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

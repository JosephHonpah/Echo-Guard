# EchoGuard Demo Limitations

The current EchoGuard demo is a frontend prototype that showcases the user interface and workflow. This document outlines the current limitations and what would be needed for a full production implementation.

## Current Demo Limitations

1. **Simulated File Uploads**:
   - Files selected for upload are not actually sent to any server
   - No S3 storage is implemented in the demo
   - The upload progress and completion are simulated with timeouts

2. **No Audio Processing**:
   - No actual audio transcription occurs
   - Amazon Transcribe is not connected in the demo
   - Transcripts shown are pre-defined examples

3. **No AI Analysis**:
   - No connection to Amazon Bedrock or Kiro AI
   - Compliance scores and issues are simulated
   - Analysis results are static examples

4. **Limited Backend Functionality**:
   - Authentication works through Amazon Cognito
   - No Lambda functions for processing
   - No DynamoDB for storing results
   - No SNS for notifications

5. **Static Dashboard Data**:
   - Dashboard displays static example data
   - Recordings shown are not from actual uploads
   - Compliance metrics are pre-defined

## Required for Full Implementation

1. **Backend Services**:
   - Deploy Lambda functions for processing uploads
   - Set up Amazon Transcribe for audio-to-text conversion
   - Configure Amazon Bedrock for compliance analysis
   - Integrate Kiro AI for specialized financial compliance

2. **Storage and Database**:
   - Configure S3 buckets for audio storage
   - Set up DynamoDB tables for storing results
   - Implement proper access controls and lifecycle policies

3. **API Integration**:
   - Deploy API Gateway for frontend-backend communication
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Set up CORS and security headers

4. **Real Processing Pipeline**:
   - Create event-driven workflow for audio processing
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Set up monitoring and logging

5. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Connect to real backend APIs
   - Implement real-time status updates
   - Add proper error handling for failed uploads or processing

## Next Steps

To move from the demo to a full implementation:

1. Follow the deployment instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Deploy the backend resources as described in the architecture
3. Update the frontend code to connect to the real backend
4. Test the complete workflow with actual audio files
5. Implement monitoring and alerting for production use

# EchoGuard Final Deployment

The EchoGuard application has been successfully deployed and tested!

## Deployment Summary

### Backend Resources

- **Cognito User Pool**: `us-east-1_s8Kk4WRpo`
- **Cognito App Client**: `5feka1pptsb57glg092tcefr3p`
- **API Gateway**: `https://nqfzeccch0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- **Lambda Functions**: All deployed and functional
- **S3 Buckets**: Created for audio files, transcripts, and Lambda code
- **DynamoDB Tables**: Set up for recordings and analysis results
- **SNS Topics**: Configured for notifications and event handling

### Frontend Configuration

- Frontend is now connected to the real backend (demo mode disabled)
- CloudFront distribution is serving the updated files
- Test page available at: `https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/test-auth.html`

### Test User

- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `Test1234!`

## Project Organization

The project has been organized into a cleaner structure:

- **Backend**: Contains all Lambda functions, CloudFormation templates, and tests
- **Frontend**: Contains the web interface code
- **Docs**: Organized documentation by category
  - **config**: JSON configuration files
  - **deployment**: Deployment-related documentation
  - **guides**: User and developer guides

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests have been created for the Lambda functions:
- `test_upload_handler.py`: Tests the upload handler Lambda function
- `mock_test_upload_handler.py`: Mock tests that don't require AWS SDK

### Integration Tests

A test HTML page has been created to test the API integration:
- URL: `https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/test-auth.html`
- This page allows you to:
  - Authenticate with Cognito
  - Test the API endpoints
  - Verify the end-to-end flow

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage**: Keep an eye on CloudWatch metrics and logs
2. **Add More Tests**: Create additional tests for other Lambda functions
3. **Enhance Security**: Review IAM permissions and implement least privilege
4. **Optimize Costs**: Set up lifecycle policies and auto-scaling
5. **Add Features**: Consider adding more features like:
   - User management dashboard
   - Advanced analytics
   - Custom compliance rules

## Accessing the Application

The main application is available at:
- URL: `https://d4t0hj4peur25.cloudfront.net/auth.html`

You can use the test user credentials or sign up for a new account.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs**: Each Lambda function has its own log group
2. **Verify API Gateway**: Test endpoints in the API Gateway console
3. **Check Cognito**: Ensure user authentication is working correctly
4. **S3 Permissions**: Verify bucket policies and CORS configuration

## Conclusion

The EchoGuard application is now fully deployed and ready for use. The serverless architecture ensures scalability and cost-efficiency, while the comprehensive testing ensures reliability.

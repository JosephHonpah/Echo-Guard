# EchoGuard Kiro Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use Kiro AI assistant effectively with the EchoGuard project.

## Getting Started with Kiro

Kiro is an AI assistant and IDE built to assist developers. For EchoGuard, we've configured Kiro with project-specific knowledge, automation hooks, and development standards.

## Key Kiro Features for EchoGuard

### 1. Specs for Structured Development

Specs provide a structured approach to building complex features:

| Spec | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `audio-processing-pipeline` | Audio processing workflow | `#Spec: audio-processing-pipeline` |
| `frontend-implementation` | React frontend development | `#Spec: frontend-implementation` |
| `compliance-analysis-engine` | AI compliance analysis | `#Spec: compliance-analysis-engine` |
| `deployment-workflow` | CI/CD and deployment | `#Spec: deployment-workflow` |

Example usage:
```
#Spec: audio-processing-pipeline
Help me implement the Lambda function for initiating transcription jobs.
```

### 2. Automated Hooks

Hooks automate common development tasks:

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Run Tests | Save Python files | Run unit tests |
| Validate CloudFormation | Save YAML files | Validate templates |
| Analyze Transcript | Manual | Check compliance issues |
| Test Frontend | Save React files | Run frontend tests |
| Update Documentation | Manual | Keep docs in sync |
| Generate Compliance Report | Manual | Create compliance reports |
| Security Review | Manual | Review security practices |
| Cost Optimization | Manual | Find cost savings |

To run a hook manually:
1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Kiro: Run Hook"
3. Select the hook you want to run

### 3. Development Standards

Kiro enforces consistent standards through steering files:

| Standard | Applied To | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| AWS Best Practices | All AWS resources | Security, cost, performance |
| Python Standards | Python files | Code quality, error handling |
| React Standards | React files | Component design, performance |

These standards are automatically applied when working with relevant files.

## Common Workflows with Kiro

### Implementing a New Feature

1. Start with a spec:
   ```
   #Spec: audio-processing-pipeline
   I need to implement a new feature for detecting PII in transcripts.
   ```

2. Get implementation guidance:
   ```
   How should I structure the Lambda function to detect PII in transcripts?
   ```

3. Review the implementation:
   ```
   #File: backend/lambda/detect_pii.py
   Review this implementation for security and Python standards compliance.
   ```

### Troubleshooting Issues

1. Debug deployment errors:
   ```
   I'm getting this CloudFormation error: "Resource of type 'AWS::Lambda::Function' with identifier 'AnalyzeTranscriptFunction' already exists."
   How do I fix this?
   ```

2. Performance issues:
   ```
   The transcript analysis Lambda is timing out. How can I optimize it?
   ```

### Architecture Decisions

1. Get guidance on design choices:
   ```
   What's the best way to structure the DynamoDB table for storing compliance results?
   ```

2. Review architecture decisions:
   ```
   Review our current architecture for multi-region resilience. What improvements can we make?
   ```

## Best Practices for Using Kiro with EchoGuard

1. **Reference Files**: Always reference specific files when asking for help:
   ```
   #File: infrastructure/echoguard-complete.yaml
   Help me optimize this CloudFormation template.
   ```

2. **Use Specs for Complex Features**: Start with a spec for major features:
   ```
   #Spec: compliance-analysis-engine
   Help me implement the risk scoring algorithm.
   ```

3. **Leverage Hooks for Automation**: Use hooks to automate repetitive tasks:
   ```
   #Hook: security-review
   ```

4. **Follow Standards**: Refer to steering files for best practices:
   ```
   What's the recommended way to handle errors in Lambda functions according to our Python standards?
   ```

5. **Collaborative Development**: Share Kiro conversations with team members for knowledge sharing.

## Extending Kiro for EchoGuard

### Adding New Specs

1. Create a new markdown file in `.kiro/specs/`
2. Define requirements, design, and implementation tasks
3. Add references to relevant files

### Adding New Hooks

1. Create a new JSON file in `.kiro/hooks/`
2. Define the trigger events, file patterns, and command
3. Provide a prompt for Kiro to use

### Adding New Steering Files

1. Create a new markdown file in `.kiro/steering/`
2. Add front matter with inclusion rules
3. Define standards and best practices

## Troubleshooting Kiro

If you encounter issues with Kiro:

1. **Hook not running**: Check the file pattern and event trigger
2. **Spec not found**: Verify the spec name and path
3. **MCP tools not working**: Ensure uvx is installed and configured
